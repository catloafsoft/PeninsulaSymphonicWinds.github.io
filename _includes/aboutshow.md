Loosely based on _The Children’s Hour_, a work of Lillian Hellman from 1934, Judge Young’s final script, _Finishing School_, will bring smiles—and tears of hilarity—to all in attendance. 

For those of you who do not know of Lillian Hellman and her work (which includes virtually every single person reading this), here’s a little background. She wrote a number of Broadway dramas in the 30’s and through the 40’s. Although the plays were dismal, dreadful, drab, dire, depressing, and disconsolate, they were extremely popular on the Great White Way. So admired was she as a writer that she was lured to Hollywood, where she was in high demand as a screen writer!

Directed by Gail Wagner, a cast of 22 plus some special cameos bring to life a school for girls in 1935 and their antics, with adventure, dancing, plot-twists, and more than 20 songs. As always, our live band, directed by Hon. James McGiffin, will entertain (and occasionally amuse) you!

Let the music begin. We hope you have a great time!
