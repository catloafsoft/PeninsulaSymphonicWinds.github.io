# A Look Back from the Director's Chair

It starts with a writer's idea that becomes words on a page and notes on a staff. Then it becomes a director's vision of what those words and notes could become being spoken and sung. Casting is done, rehearsals begin, and then the magic happens. And there was plenty of magic in the year-long journey that brought _Anna Karenina: From Train to Trial_ to stages in Wilmington and Dover.

Producing a complex, original musical that's never been performed before was a unique challenge that required every cast and crew member to dig deep and bring their best to the project. Oh, and did I mention that Selena Molina, the author who brilliantly transformed a turgid tale of Imperial Russian betrayal into a hysterical comic parody, was in the cast?

From Jim McGiffin's inspired musical direction to Erin Della Barca's imaginative choreography to the insight and humor each performer brought to their characters, this show was truly the creative accomplishment of a talented and dedicated community of professionals. And I don't just mean legal professionals. I mean artistic professionals. If this group ever decides to leave the law behind and take this show on the road, they'll all be embarked on successful second careers. And I'd be honored to go with them.
