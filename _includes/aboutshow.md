## Anna Karenina: From Trains to Trial

Get ready to be dazzled and delighted by our upcoming extravaganza _Anna Karenina: From Train to Trial_! Critics are buzzing\* with excitement about this wild ride of a show. Written by our own Selena Molina in the spirit and style of our beloved departed Robert Young, this production is loosely based (okay, not at all based) on Tolstoy’s classic tale.

With a cast of 20 vibrant characters, a full band, and 21 toe-tapping tunes, dive headfirst into a whirlwind of love, betrayal, political intrigue, and... did we mention love? You’ll leave the theater wondering if this was a parody, or if Tolstoy plagiarized our legendary Profundo Bono production (albeit 120 years before our playwright was born).

This year’s Wilmington performances (Friday 11/15/24 and Saturday 11/16/24) will again return to the vibrant Laird Performing Arts Center at Tatnall School, 1501 Barley Mill Rd, Wilmington. Our Sunday matinee in Dover (11/17/24) has found a new home at the Education & Humanities Theatre of Delaware State University, 1200 N Dupont Hwy, Dover.

\*They would be raving if they could see it. But alas, even the critics have to wait until November for our exclusive three-show run. Mark your calendars and prepare for an unforgettable night of theater magic!

## From the Director’s Chair

Societal hypocrisy, doomed adulterous affairs, endless train stations, intrusive in-laws, pretentious authors, backstabbing friends, greedy lawyers, 21 song parodies, and a grand finale courtroom scene... it’s all in a day’s work for the cast of _Anna Karenina_.

When I was approached to take on this project, my first question was: who would have the audacity to turn one of the greatest works of literature ever written into a musical? The answer, of course, was Selena Molina, who somehow brilliantly transformed a turgid tale of Imperial Russian betrayal into the hysterical comic parody our talented cast will be bringing to the stage in November. And speaking of talent, did I mention that our author will also be appearing in the role of Kitty?

Like any other ambitious large-scale production, what happens offstage is often as entertaining as what happens onstage... like the memorable day I informed the cast that they would be performing their roles employing Russian accents. That was nearly my last day as director, but everyone rose to the occasion, found their best Boris and Natasha voices, and soldiered on.

It’s always a good sign when the cast of a comedy laughs a lot during rehearsals, and that has certainly been the case with us. As crazy as this job seemed at the beginning, it has been a joy to work with this gifted group of legal thespians to create something original, engaging, and endlessly entertaining. They can’t wait to share this madness with an audience, and neither can I. While Tolstoy might not get it, you will. So hop on board before this theatrical train leaves the station.

I wonder though, what’s next? _War and Peace_?
