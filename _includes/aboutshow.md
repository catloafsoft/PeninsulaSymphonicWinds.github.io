Get ready to be dazzled and delighted by our upcoming extravaganza _Anna Karenina: From Train to Trial_! Critics are buzzing\* with excitement about this wild ride of a show. Written by our own Selena Molina in the spirit and style of our beloved departed Robert Young, this production is loosely based (okay, not at all based) on Tolstoy’s classic tale.

With a cast of 20 vibrant characters, a full band, and 21 toe-tapping tunes, dive headfirst into a whirlwind of love, betrayal, political intrigue, and... did we mention love? You’ll leave the theater wondering if this was a parody, or if Tolstoy plagiarized our legendary Profundo Bono production (albeit 120 years before our playwright was born).

This year’s Wilmington performances (Friday 11/15/24 and Saturday 11/16/24) will again return to the vibrant Laird Performing Arts Center at Tatnall School, 1501 Barley Mill Rd, Wilmington. Our Sunday matinee in Dover (11/17/24) has found a new home at the Education & Humanities Theatre of Delaware State University, 1200 N Dupont Hwy, Dover.

\*They would be raving if they could see it. But alas, even the critics have to wait until November for our exclusive three-show run. Mark your calendars and prepare for an unforgettable night of theater magic!
