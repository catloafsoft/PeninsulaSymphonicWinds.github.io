Ticket proceeds do provide some revenue, but our major contribution to worthy institutions such as the Combined Campaign for Justice comes from sponsorships and advertising placements in the programs that are distributed to those that attend.

### SPONSORSHIPS

We have three levels of sponsorship, separately designated in our program:

#### “The Tony”

For only $2,500, this sponsorship level provides you with the following benefits:

* Being specially identified in our program among the elite sponsors in this category
* A full-page ad in the program (valued at $500)
* 20 tickets to whichever performance(s) you would like
* Depending upon availability, additional tickets at a discounted price

#### “The Critics’ Circle”

For only $2,000, this sponsorship level provides you with the following benefits:

* Being specially identified in our program among the elite sponsors in this category
* A full-page ad in the program (valued at $500)
* 15 tickets to whichever performance(s) you would like
* Depending upon availability, additional tickets at a discounted price

#### “The Ovation”

For only $1,500, this sponsorship level provides you with the following benefits:

* Being specially identified as a sponsor in our program
* A full-page ad in the program (valued at $500)
* 10 tickets to whichever performance(s) you would like
* Depending upon availability, additional tickets at a discounted price

You can imagine the great exposure to a fine audience of people who purchase goods and services, in addition ultimately to helping deserving people who really need the assistance. As you can imagine, there is also a high concentration of lawyers, legal professionals, court professionals and para-professionals, and legal staff who attend our shows, so your audience comes naturally targeted.

### PROGRAM ADVERTISING.

Even if you don’t choose to become a sponsor, a very significant portion of the proceeds we donate come from program advertising in our program, which is distributed free to each ticket holder. The rates are extremely reasonable:

* Full page ads are $500.00
* Half-page ads are $250.00

Persons interested in becoming sponsors or placing program ads should contact:
