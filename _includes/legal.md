Legal (disclaimers, not actors):

Since we are a bunch of lawyers and legal professionals, surely you didn’t think you’d come to our event without agreeing to a bunch of express and implied covenants?? Well here they are. By buying our tickets, attending our show, breathing our name, or laying eyes upon our logo, you unconditionally and irrevocably agree to the following.

“Behave yourself during the show and don’t sue us.”

(More disclaimers, terms and conditions coming soon, to which you will be bound even if you buy your tickets before the update.)
